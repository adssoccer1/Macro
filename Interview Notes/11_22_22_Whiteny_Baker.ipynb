    "For 40 years, weve known nothing but falling rates and tailwinds for all assets and this hyperfinacialization of assets. This is risk on. This goes back to 71 under Nixon. The first thing was depegging from gold which was a constraint to lending, but that was unleashed. Then we had derecognition of tawain, brining china into the wto which gave us all the supply to meet the demand from the depeg from gold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Western businesses were huge beneficiaries of this. Prfit share of GDP grew because us comanies could offshore and get inputs cheaply. Wealth of GDP also grew. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we had the second period post GFC. The GFC occured because credit hit a wall and we began a global deleveragin perssure so everywher in the world was deleveraging. So then we had central bank step in to offset the deleveragin pressue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third one is post covid where we saw such an exterme degreeo of money printing. Total base money and credit creates all the money possible to be played with in the economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022 we went risk off starting at the highet valuations in history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Market caps need to connect back to the level of cash-flows that these assets produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emerging Markets have a lot of countries that dont have these cashflow market cap disconnects. They have also dealth with inflationary environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In EMs there is less debt taken on by participants because there is more volatility. So these countries have healthier balance sheets because they have to deal with inflation and no fed puts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022 we had a inflationary  recession. You could have an inflationary recssion because 1) you have a supply shock or 2) In an EM kind of way you are spending a lot more than you make, you are running hot, importing a lot, inflation is high, its lates in the cycle, you are very depending on foreign flows, and then something happens to those foreign flows. So you naturally are setting yourself up to get hurt by these flows. So lets say there is a global shock, you have to adjust your current account immediately. You cant ease into it there is fiscal contraction, monetary tightening, there is a recession, and your currency is collaspsing. This is what the UK is expereincing in 2022. They started with a huge current account deficit and then had a hige 4-5% of gdp eneergy shock. These guys will now have to raise rates 400 bps to stop their currency from collapsing. They need to increase real rates to defend their currency otherwise the currency collapse will reinforce the inflation and then you have a domestic inflation spiral and an external inflation spiral that feeds into that. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022 its unknown what the impact of the wealth shock will be. Asset prices have declined significanlty but this is after a massive wealth boom to GDP. So will the decline in asset prices have a reverse wealth effect? Totem does case studies, one such is the .com bubble. Nominal GDP never contracted after the .com. Nominal spending didnt go anywhere except for upp after the .com bubble. So whitney guesses spending isnt going to go anywhere even after -20% year in 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "For years globalization has now organized the world into demand centers over here and suppliers over here and nobody cared about the security of this arrangment for a while because the U.S. garunteed it through amry security and financiallly with fed put and protecting from recessions ect. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sellers of goods like china, taiwan, koreas, saudis with oil, all had surpluses from selling us stuff that they could buy treasuries from us. So at no period pre 2020 was there no country not buying USTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These countries began spending this money on themselves inveting in their infrastructure and by virtue of doing that they stopped buying assets in the us which means they close their current account surpluses to some degree. china had a big property and infrastruture boom. \n",
    "\n",
    "Post GFC the US was the only country were rates got off the ground. So us risky assets and bonds got a lot of bond inflows due to the carry. Taiwaneese lifers and japans banks and the US fed were all buying bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "US is a demand center that gets it supply from a cheap source of labor in china. So ripping apart these supply chains is inflationary and companies also have to spend more to resetablish their supply chains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Totem sees huge divergences between EMs. This is an opportunity for alpha. Right now totem is selling last cycles winners and buying things that are troughing with expolisve earnings potential. Taiwan is an example of this. The earnings on their equity index \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK, is fiscal easing into a balance of payments crisis. Its demonstrating what it like for DM running twin deficits in the evironment of contracting globabl liquidity where there is no longer a structural bid for their assets. This is just naturally what happens after a supply shock that creates a balance of payments pressure. They had been stimulating so much and had not had to respond to an inflationary environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The U.K. has been fiscal easing into a balance of payments crisis. When there is no longer any structural bid for their assets at then they start issuing more due to larger fiscal deficits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But DM have gotten used to printing and \"eating free lunches\". They just print and have gotten used to all the printing not having any consequences not having to stop them because of inflation, essentially printing has been a free lunch. Then you see EMs like Colombia taling about how they are fiscally tightening by 3 pts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022s drawdown there wasnt any real signs of stress. Nothing really broke. \n",
    "Going into 2022 everyone would of though 2-4pts of tightening would have been unbearable but in reality:\n",
    "Credit card deliquencies were fine, defaults and bankruptcies were contain, \n",
    "\n",
    "bid ask spreads in the treasury market bloew out to 1-2 bps but then those came down.\n",
    "No emergency liqeuidity facilities at the fed being utilizied. \n",
    "SLO losses minimal.\n",
    "Avs spreads showed no spreads. \n",
    "Even the forthiest tip of credit borrowing showed no sign of stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "You dont see debt squeezes unless you see immediate financing needs that cannot get me, like you cant get rolled. Some of the really forthy negative free clashflow startups will be hit by this but this is a localized issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There was nothing large enough at the debt service level to be a serious threat as a result of the high interest rates. And this would remain this way until the gap between nominal cashflow growth and interest rates to a narower level until some people are actually on the wrong side of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the liquidity side in 2022, QE creates reserves on the bank balances sheets, but it also creates deposits to the extent that the bonds are bought from a nonbank seller. This means you have a lot of excess deposits sitting there and people look at cash balances in money market mutual funds and conclude people are ultra risk averse, but these levels are high because of QE mecahnically. There is also 1.6 trillion in the RRP of excess bank liquidity and the cumulative amount of reserves is many trilion greater than it was a few years ago. So all of this liequidity buffer is sitting here accomodating the trading of assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that is happening is assets are falling, its not that markets are not working. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately it was a money funded bubble, not a debt funded bubble, so when the money stopped in 2022, the assets fell... \n",
    "\n",
    "Totem looks for \"Extreme aligned assytmetries where your downside is protected, there all these ways I can win, im aware theres going to be volatility, not one month swings. \" Fund manager sentinment, or spec positioning, individual manager sentimenet, FTFC positioning, imm, These are just tiney slivers of prices movements but they are not major flows. Like considering the broad inflows and outflows of EM mutual funds is a much higher singal and larger flow than tactical positiong indicators that so many peopel pay attention to. "
