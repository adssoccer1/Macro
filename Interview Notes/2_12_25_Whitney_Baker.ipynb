    "There are two sources of money creation:\n",
    "1) Expanding credit - which goes into goods and services.\n",
    "2) Money  Creation - this is bank reserves. When the fed is printing or central banks are creating base money. Rates used to follow supply of money. But going back to the GFC we saw a huge deleveraging pressure as the private sector works through their balance sheets. But the fed doesnt want defaltion so what they do to keep total finacning flat is Money creation! This offsets the lack of credit creation post the GFC.\n",
    "\n",
    "This injection of money puts a floor under assets prices. Money creation goes through these financial channels whereas credit creation goes through the real economy channels. So we get asset price inflation which is why we see market cap to gdp at such extreme levels. GDP is financed by credit. Money printing only goes into the real economy by push out risk and through wealth effects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spending is now no longer dependent on credit, but rather on the amount of money in the system. Plus its heavily connected to wealth effects from high asset prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The supply of money is now completely disconnected from the cost of money (interest rates). Pre-GFC, the fed would manage interet rates by changes the amount of bank reserves in the system!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeilds and stock prices are a function of how much money is now in the system. A lot of people think high stocks are a result of low yeilds, but actually high stocks and low yeilds are a result of the huge amount of money printing!\n",
    "\n",
    "The asset bubble is now so big the the Fed, knows they cannot burst it because there would be massive balance sheet fall out. So to choke of the high nominal spending + income enviroment we are in they are stuggling to do it by contracting liquidity because the asset bubble could burst which would be a systemic risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "The central banks also have a pavalonion response to backstopping their sovereign debt markets. See the UK gilt crisis. See the SVB crisis. The btfp saw base reserves contracting in 2022 to expaning again in 2023 due to the BTFP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fiscal deficit also blew out from 5 to 8% of gdp in 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "When then have the well known fixed rate debt problem that did not allow the rise in rates to contract spending. There also was already not much credit going on in this cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any reduction there was in credit in 2022 has been offset by the fiscal expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "During late march to early may the rally in AI began because of a lot of retail inflow that was down the chain of base money expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we also have the bill-note ratio reduce long end bond issuance. When they issued a lot of bills the MMFs in the RRP bought all the bills. When the gov shrank the bill stock that money went into the RRP and when the bills grew we see the RRP drain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Europe does not have a large portion of fixed rate private debt, so when they raised rates post covid, their economies slowed. Plus they had a fiscal drag, whereas the us had a fiscal boost. This caused goods prices to fall globably but we are already seeing goods demand growing again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation slowed in a transitory manner because of the global goods deflation, but remains stick because of services. The services inflation is a reflection of the domestic overheating, specifically the strong wage growth and spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the world is coming out of these recessions now and have choked off their inflation problems. But this is going to remove the disinflationary pressure from global goods deflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**but wait what about how immigration has helped ease services inflation in the us? - aidan **\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that other countries are rebounding and have lower inflation, interest rate differentials should also be widening because they will be easing in the rest of the world, but not in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally in this bubble the dollar has rallied with the tech bubble. This is becaues foriegners were putting dollars into U.S. equities. Perhaps the reason the dolalr didnt rally in 2023 is because the bubble grew dew to domestic flows, but not foregin flows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to equity outperfromance, foreigners have their largest ever exposure to us assets, so they may begin to sell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forgeiners dont stick around for negative returns in the assets and the currency....\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emerging Markets\n",
    "People invest in EMs like they are all one country, even though individual country's conditions are radically different. EM through time is a good alpha landscape. They treat EM as one homogenous asset class. \n",
    "\n",
    "BRICS used to be what FAANG is today. When expectations for BRICS was disapointed capital left. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to changes in monetary flows, when QE stops and there is QT or rate hikes, the assets that were receiving the easy flows get hit the hardest, the flows do not necessarily leave EM. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of trading is narrative driven and backwards looking. Instead one needs to ask \"why does that thing matter? Which flow does it connect to? Is it a large flow? Where is that flow going? Which asset is it supporting? And when does that flow stop?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Totem has a framework which is a money and credit flows framework which lets them test out what is driving a specific flow. They have a process for taking in news flow accross the 35 countries x 6 asset classes every day. There is a lot of narrative that are actually very small flows relative to actuall flow with real size like pension fund movements that drive the trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"People tend to focus on these week to week narratives, but broadly speaking these things do not matter. So what totem tries to do is to think at the highet level first. Money creation works through financial channels into assets, credit works through economic channels. So okay which players are taking their investments and putting them into which assets and what are driving those players?\"\" \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at something like NVDIA for example, we can say okay retail is the one driving this rally so its a retail flow then what will stop this buying? well the halting of the expansion of the Fed balance sheet will stop this flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be emerging market stocks. A lot of the flow that goes into EM stocks is from foreigners that look for momentum. So cross-border flow chases what has done well, so what you see is an asset that is running hot where there is a current account deficit, fiscal deficit and the currency is expensive and depending on foreign flows. This was basically EMs in 2011, or BRICS in 2011. But then when this foreign flow of money stops to these countries, you begin to see a balance of payments crisis. The currency falls, the rates goes up, fiscal tightens, private credit creation falls, the economy weakens, import spending goes down, and the current account closes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if a country has a large current account which requires a lot of foreign investment, but that gap closes, then once this process troughs the currency will stabalize, inflation will come down, rates can ease, credit eases, economies rebound. So thats what the beginning of the rally in these EMs looks like. Then foreigners see this momentum begin to pick up and they chase these returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its useful to listen to monetary policy makers to the extent that you understand their bias or how they react to data. But it is not worth trying to decipher what they think they will do in the short-term, because they dont even know themselves!"
